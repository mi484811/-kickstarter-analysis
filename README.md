#Overview of Project

##Purpose 
To discover the trend of plays over the months within the year and if launch dates of plays combined with funding goals impact campaigns. Previously prepared dataset given by Louise, created visual charts according to goals and launch date to see trends. 

##Overview of Analysis Screenshots 
The summer months and late spring are when theaters are the most successful but slightly follow each other dips throughout the year.  
Percentage of successful plays declines as money goals increase. 

##Challenges 
The obstacle faced during the project was the limitation of knowledge. To overcome this obstacle, I researched topics on my own using google and asked my inner circle about their experience with excel and issue that they came across and how they overcame them. As a visual learner, I also used YouTube for my research.  

#Results
##Conclusions are made about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date 
Theaters are more successful at the end of April and the beginning of May. Afterward, there was a decline in its success. There is only one month in which theaters do not cancel the show in October. Another conclusion we see in the chart is failed, and success of a theater meet right the in the middle of December. 

##Conclusion is made about the Outcomes based on Goals 
Plays are more likely to fail as the goal for money increases.

#Summary of the Limitations
The dataset given by Louise is a small dataset for the project's scope and does include several countries, but the criteria to be placed in the dataset were not mentioned, so I believe the dataset lacks quality data. One question would be school plays. Would they be considered to be placed in the dataset? Several specialized high schools produce plays with budgets. Are they not worth being analyzed? Then there are the streaming services that provide content via their platform. Would recorded plays be a different data set than plays? The criteria for the dataset were not explained when given, and therefore I believe many projects were not included that would have skewed the charts and given better insight.
