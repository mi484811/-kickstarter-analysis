# Overview of Project

### Background
Louise has decided to create a campaign to fundraise for her play Fever and anticipates she will need a budget of 10,000. She has reached out to me to use my knowledge of excel to help uncover factors that make a theater play successful. Louise came close to reaching her fundraising goals.

### Purpose 
To discover the trend of plays over the months within the year and if launch dates of plays combined with funding goals impact campaigns. 

# Analysis and Challenges
### Overview of Analysis Screenshots 
### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
The summer months and late spring are when theaters are the most successful but slightly follow each other dips throughout the year. A person can argue that summer plays see more success due to schools being out, which leads to families seeking entertainment and plays being of their choice.

### Outcomes Based on Goals 
Percentage of successful plays declines as money goals increase. It appears that the charts contradict themselves. We would have to go back in excel and create a chart that integrates funding goals and the month to see a clearer picture of the driving force behind the success of plays. Is it all about the money? Or timing is everything? 

### Challenges 
The obstacle faced during the project was the limitation of knowledge. To overcome this obstacle, I researched topics on my own using google and asked my inner circle about their experience with excel and issue that they came across and how they overcame them. As a visual learner, I also used YouTube for my research.  

# Results
### Conclusions are made about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date 
Theaters are more successful at the end of April and the beginning of May. Afterward, there was a decline in its success. There is only one month in which theaters do not cancel the show in October. Another conclusion we see in the chart is failed, and success of a theater meet right the in the middle of December. 

### Conclusion is made about the Outcomes based on Goals 
Plays are more likely to fail as the goal for money increases.

# Summary of the Limitations
The dataset provided by Louise did not mention the criteria to be placed in the dataset were not mentioned, so I believe the dataset lacks quality data. One question would be school plays if fundraising for school plays would be/should be included in the dataset. Putting on a play is no easy task, whether in school or out of one. Several theater high schools produce plays with budgets. Would school plays fundraising be considered outside the scope of the project? Then there are the streaming services that provide content via their platform. Would recorded plays be a different data set than plays? The criteria for the dataset were not explained when given, and therefore I believe many projects were not included that would have skewed the charts and given better insight.
